# Secure data hiding in images using steganography​
## Project Overview  
This project implements image steganography, a technique for hiding secret messages inside images using Python. The hidden message can be retrieved only using the correct passcode.  

This technique allows for covert communication, making the message invisible to the human eye while ensuring data integrity.  

## How It Works  
1. **Encryption (Hiding a Message)**  
   - A secret message is embedded into an image file by modifying pixel values.  
   - The message is stored in a way that does not distort the image visibly.  
   - A passcode is required for decryption.  

2. **Decryption (Extracting the Hidden Message)**  
   - The encoded image is processed to extract the original hidden message.  
   - The correct passcode must be entered to reveal the message.  


## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `OpenCV` → Image processing    
  - `OS` → File handling
 
    OpenCV can be installed via pip:
    pip install opencv-python

## Features
- Data Hiding → Hides text inside image pixels without visible distortion.
- Password Protection → Ensures only authorized users can extract the message.
- Lossless Encryption → Uses PNG format to prevent data corruption.
- Simple & Lightweight → No complex setup required.
- Can Be Extended → Future work includes audio & video steganography.

## Future Scope
- GUI-Based Application – Develop a user-friendly interface for non-programmers.
- Multi-Media Steganography – Extend to hide messages in audio & video files.
- AI-Powered Steganalysis – Implement machine learning to detect hidden messages.
- Multi-Layer Encoding – Introduce advanced encryption before embedding messages.
